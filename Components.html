            <div> I chose this keyboard mainly based on the detachable palmrest and is mechanical. For gaming, mechanical keyboards are a must. The palmrest is a unique design that lets you rest yor hands on it providing premium comfort. Without the palmrest gamers cannot go for many hours at a time because thier hands start to get sore. The Aircraft-Grade Aluminum Alloy is very durable making the keyboard last longer. The dongle requires a USB 3.0 port and is available on the PC to connect the mouse to the computer wirelessly. Overall the mouse is compatible with the PC.</div>
            <br>
            <div> A computer mouse enables its user to move a cursor smoothly and intuitively across a two-dimensional plane. It's therefore an essential input device for selecting, dragging, hovering, and clicking.</div>

            <br>
            <div> I mainly chose this CPU cooler because it eliminates fan noise and is compatible with the case. This CPU cooler uses something called Precise Pump Control which maximizes performance and minimizes fan noise. Also this fan fits perfectly in the measurements of the case. This CPU cooler also uses magnetic levitation improving airflow to the CPU. Overall, at this price point, no other CPU cooler will deliver the cooling the Corsair Liquid Cooling CPU cooler does.</div>
            <br>
            <div> A CPU cooler is device designed to draw heat away from the system CPU and other components in the enclosure. Using a CPU cooler to lower CPU temperatures improves efficiency and stability of the system.</div>

                <B><u>Corsair Link Software</u> - is a unified software that allows for the monitoring and control of multiple Corsair products. The software is capable of identifying and monitoring system sensors, such as the CPU temperature or fan speeds, and can use that information for the programming of user-specific performance profiles.</B>
